\begin{document}
\maketitle

\comment{Note, please do not write as a conventional report with
  intoduction, method, results, discussion, conclusion.  Instead use
  the following headings, with a page per section.}


\section{Architecture overview}

\comment{Here you should describe your computer's architecture (such
  as the cache organisation, memory size, CPU model, etc.).}


\section{Multithreading}

\comment{Here you should analyse and discuss how your program takes
  advantage of multiple cores.}


\section{Cache}

\comment{Here you should analyse how your program makes optimal use
  of the cache.}


\section{Profiling}

\comment{Here you should analyse which parts of the program take the
  most time.  Cache profiling should be discussed in the Cache
  section}.


\section{Compiler optimisation}

\comment{Here you should provide your analysis of compiler
  optimisation options.}


\section{Individual topic 1 (Road Runner)}

\comment{The individual topics are to be written independently and
  address an aspect of computer architecture related to the
  assignment.  For example, using SIMD instructions, using the GPU,
  comparing two different computers, analysing branch prediction,
  optimisation, caching etc. in more detail.  The topics must be
  unique per group.}

\section{Individual topic 2 (Wile E. Coyote)}
